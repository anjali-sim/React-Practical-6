# React-Practical-6

- In this Practical, I have used .env files for declaring environment variables for different stages.
- I have defined three different .env files for development, staging and production.
- I have used Vite.js for configuring the environment variables.
- In package.json, I have defined the different builds for the environment variables.
- I have installed dotenv and http-server in vite for its management.
